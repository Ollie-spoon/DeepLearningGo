# DeepLearningGo
My journey creating a replica of Deepminds AlphaGo Zero from the ground up.

This project is following "Deep Learning and the Game of Go".

A usefull guide to using Keras is at /dlgo/keras_testing/keras_mnist. This contains a page long breakdown of all of the key things to consider when creating a model in Keras. All of the advice is from a logical not a practical point of view so this is all equaly applicable for the exact same programme written in PyTorch.
